# ðŸ–§ local-traffic

That is a secure http/2 (or insecure http1.1) reverse-proxy installed on your machine

- with 0 transitive dependency
- with 1 install step
- with a startup time of a few milliseconds
- with one 59kb index.js file

How simple is that ?

## pre-requisite

node.js >= 8

## how to start in less than one minute

```bash
npx local-traffic
```

> sudo prefix only required for Linux, when port number < 1024

## how to use it

1. Change the mapping object in the `.local-traffic.json` file:

```json
{
  "mapping": {
    "/npm/": "https://www.npmjs.com/",
    "/my-static-webapp/": "file:///home/user/projects/my-static-webapp/",
    "/welcome/": "data:text/html,<a href=\"https://acme.com/acme.js\">See my hobby project</a>",
    "/config/": "config://",
    "/logs/": "logs://",
    "/recorder/": "recorder://",
    "/jquery-local/jquery.js": {
      "replaceBody": "https://mycdn.net/jquery/jquery-3.6.4.js",
      "downstreamUrl": "file:///home/user/projects/zepto/dist/zepto.js"
    },
    "": "https://github.com/"
  }
}
```

> if you need to deactivate a mapping entry, move it below the "" key

2. Go to [http://localhost:8080/prettier](http://localhost:8080/prettier) with your browser
3. Go to [http://localhost:8080/npm/](http://localhost:8080/npm) with your browser
4. Go to [http://localhost:8080/my-static-webapp/index.html](http://localhost:8080/my-static-webapp/index.html) with your browser (given your project name is my-static-webapp, but I am not 100% sure)
5. Go to [http://localhost:8080/logs/](http://localhost:8080/logs/) to watch the request logs
6. Go to [http://localhost:8080/config/](http://localhost:8080/config/) to change the config in a web editor
7. You can use the [http://localhost:8080/recorder/](recorder) to turn your proxy into a mock server. There is a user interface and also an API (documented [here](#recorder-api))
8. From the web config editor, create a SSL keypair and start working with a self signed SSL certificate right away
9. Your page will use /jquery-local/jquery.js instead of the CDN asset, and will serve the file from your hard drive
10. Your server now proxies the mapping that you have configured

## usage

### from your terminal, using the command line

```bash
npx local-traffic [location-of-the-local-traffic-config-file]
```

> When not specified, the location of the config file will be `$HOME/.local-traffic.json`

### from a node.js application (>= 0.0.72)

```bash
 node -e 'const { start } = require("local-traffic"); start({ /* configuration goes here */ })'
```

## how to change mappings to local / non-local

1. Open `.local-traffic.json` while running it, or use the config web editor
2. Edit the mapping keys and downstream urls
3. See the status update in the terminal, that's it.

## mapping string interpolations (>=0.0.89) 
The `mapping` entries support regular expressions, and are able to match them against the destination through string interpolation. They match a double dollar sign (`$$`) followed by the index of the value in the [match array](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/match#return_value).

For example:
```json
{
  "mappings": {
    "/(example|test)": "http://example.com/$$1"
  }
}
```

Would map both "/example" and "/test" to "http://example.com/example" and "http://example.com/test" respectively.

## all the options

All boolean settings default to false when unspecified.

- `mapping`: (`{[path: string]: string | {replaceBody: string ; downstreamUrl: string}`) routing rules (required)
- `ssl` : SSL options (can be generated from the config web editor if you don't know how to set them)
  - `ssl.cert` : (`string`) Certificate (PEM format)
  - `ssl.key` : (`string`) Private Key (PEM format)
- `port` : (`number`) port number
- `replaceRequestBodyUrls`: (`boolean`) replace every matching string from the mapping in the request body.
- `replaceResponseBodyUrls`: (`boolean`) replace every matching string from the mapping in the response body.
- `dontTranslateLocationHeader`: (`boolean`) when getting a response location header, in case `replaceResponseBodyUrls` does not change the URL, change the origin to the proxy anyway
- `dontUseHttp2Downstream`: (`boolean`) force calling downstream services in http1.1 only (to save some time)
- `simpleLogs`: (`boolean`) disable colored logs for text terminals
- `logAccessInTerminal`: (`boolean`) write an access log in the terminal on each call (defaults to false)
- `websocket`: (`boolean`) true to activate websocket connections proxying via sockets. Required for logs UI.
- `disableWebSecurity`: (`boolean`) true for easygoing values in cross origin requests or content security policy headers
- `connectTimeout`: (`number`) max time before aborting the connection (defaults to 3000ms)
- `socketTimeout`: (`number`) max time waiting for a response (defaults to 3000ms)

## recorder API

(>= 0.0.86)
The recorder can be used programmatically with an API.
This can be used if someone needs to automatically record mocks during instance provisioning
(when the machine boots up using a cloud provider for example)

The API always matches the route targetting `recorder://`.

### post, put

Arguments :
| parameter     | Type                     | Description                  | Defaults|
| ------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------------- | --------|
| mode          | "proxy" or "mock"        | server mode                  | "proxy" |
| strict        | boolean                  | errors when no mock is found | false   |
| autoRecord    | boolean                  | adds mocks from server       | false   |
| mocks         | {uniqueHash,response}[]  | mocks definition             | []      |

The recorder webapp can take care of the mocks by itself,
so `autoRecord` is only necessary when using local-traffic headless or without human
intervention

### delete

The mock config will be reset to empty : 
- `autoRecord` will be set to false
- `mocks` will be purged

### get

Retrieves the current mock configuration.
use `Accept: application/json` to use the API mode.

```bash
$ curl https://localhost:8443/recorder/ -XGET -k -H'Accept: application/json'
{"mocks":[],"strict":false,"autoRecord":false,"mode":"proxy"}
```
